- ✅ Fixed FreshHologramSetup.cs (VFX_TEMPLATE_PATH → VFX_OUTPUT_PATH)
- ✅ Updated documentation with Quick Start
- ✅ VFXARBinderMinimal verified correct

## Ready to Test
When Unity opens:
```
Menu: H3M > FreshHologram > One-Click Setup (Recommended)
```

## Files Modified
- `MetavidoVFX-main/Assets/Scripts/Editor/FreshHologramSetup.cs`
- `MetavidoVFX-main/Assets/Documentation/FRESH_HOLOGRAM_VFX_SETUP.md`
- `KnowledgeBase/LEARNING_LOG.md`

## What Failed
- Unity MCP kept timing out (Unity was loading)
- Should have waited longer or used osascript to check Unity state
