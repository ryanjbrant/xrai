# User Patterns: James Tunick

> **CANONICAL SOURCE**: `~/user-context.md` — active projects, patterns, disambiguation.
> This file is supplementary. For current project priorities and tool setup, always read `~/user-context.md` first.

**Purpose**: Historical usage observations (append-only archive).

## Core Profile

**Role**: XR/AR Developer, Unity + React Native hybrid apps
**Primary Project**: portals_main (RN 0.81 + Unity 6000.2 UAAL, AR Foundation 6.3.2)
**Tools**: Claude Code, Windsurf, Cursor, Codex, Rider (all share ~/GLOBAL_RULES.md)
**MCP**: coplay-mcp (86 tools, @latest) + github
**AI Style**: Opus 4.6 with thinking enabled

---

## Goals (Observed)

### Immediate
- [ ] Hologram recording/playback system
- [ ] Hand tracking + brush painting (Spec 012)
- [ ] VFX multi-mode switching (Spec 007)
- [ ] Icosa/Sketchfab 3D model integration (Spec 009)

### Strategic
- Fast iteration over perfect code
- Leverage existing patterns (520+ repos in KB)
- Self-improving AI development system
- Cross-platform AR/VFX (iOS, Quest, WebGL)

### Meta-Goals (How You Work)
- Reduce token waste
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Build compound learning
- Simple systems over complex

---

## Work Patterns (Learned)

### What You Do Most
1. Unity C# development (VFX, AR, hand tracking)
2. Spec-driven feature development
3. Quick fixes and iterations
4. KB organization and improvement

### Session Patterns
- Long sessions (often hit context limits)
- Multiple features per session
- Frequent console checks
- Parallel exploration paths

### Request Patterns
- "ensure" = make it comprehensive
- "always" = add to rules/systems
- Rapid-fire additional requirements mid-task
- Meta-improvement requests (improve the improver)

---

## Preferences (Observed)

### Do
- Search KB first
- Use JetBrains MCP when Rider open
- Apply spec-kit for large features
- Log discoveries to LEARNING_LOG
- Parallel tool calls
- Concise responses

### Don't
- Over-research before action
- Create multiple files when one works
- Add complexity without need
- Waste tokens on process/explanation
- Ignore existing patterns

### Communication Style
- Direct, action-oriented
- Skip preambles
- Tables over paragraphs
- Show don't explain

---

## Learning Log (Usage Patterns)

### 2026-01-21 - Session Observations

**Pattern**: Requested comprehensive intelligence system → then asked "are we overcomplicating?"
**Learning**: Start simple, add complexity only when proven needed.

**Pattern**: Multiple rapid-fire requirements in single message
**Learning**: Capture all requirements before acting, batch responses.

**Pattern**: "auto self improve without token usage"
**Learning**: Prefer git hooks, LaunchAgents, file watchers over AI-based automation.

**Pattern**: "ensure master index maintained and up to date"
**Learning**: Single source of truth preferred over distributed docs.

---

## Optimization Triggers

When James asks about:
- "speed" → Use parallel calls, skip verification steps
- "accuracy" → Use Opus 4.5, enable thinking
- "token" → Use Haiku agents, batch operations
- "automate" → Prefer non-AI solutions (scripts, hooks)
- "simplify" → Reduce files, merge systems

---

## AI Usage Optimization (Research-Backed)

### Based on RCT Evidence (METR, Microsoft Studies)

**When to Use AI Extensively**:
- New APIs/frameworks (unfamiliar territory)
- Boilerplate code generation
- Test generation
- Documentation
- Exploration/scaffolding
- Debugging with MCP (30-60% faster)

**When to Type Directly (AI Slows Down)**:
- MetavidoVFX core logic (5+ years familiarity)
- VFX Graph property binding (known patterns)
- Performance-critical compute shaders
- Complex state management you understand

**Key Metric**: <44% AI acceptance rate in mature codebases means most AI suggestions need editing.

### Optimal Workflow for James

```
Familiar code (VFX, AR) → Type directly, skip AI
New integration (Icosa, WebRTC) → AI extensively
Debugging → MCP rapid loop (read_console → edit → verify)
Boilerplate → AI always
```

### Unity MCP Quick Wins

| Task | Tool | Time Savings |
|------|------|--------------|
| Multiple errors | batch_execute | 10-100x faster |
| Console check | read_console(errors only) | 2x faster |
| Scene operations | manage_scene batch | 5x faster |
| Script validation | validate_script (Roslyn) | Catches errors pre-compile |

## Predicted Needs

Based on patterns, likely future requests:
1. Hologram playback implementation (from spec)
2. Hand tracking VFX integration
3. Performance optimization for Quest
4. Multi-user networking
5. Further KB consolidation

---

## How to Serve Better

1. **Search KB before every response** - patterns exist, use them
2. **One action per response** - don't over-deliver
3. **Log insights immediately** - to LEARNING_LOG.md
4. **Batch requirements** - capture all before acting
5. **Simplify by default** - add complexity only when asked
6. **Prefer scripts over AI** - for automation

---

## Update Protocol

When observing new patterns:
```markdown
### [Date] - [Pattern Type]

**Observed**: What happened
**Learning**: What this means for future
**Action**: How to adapt
```

Append, don't overwrite. History is valuable.
