## Core Components

### 1. Unified Knowledgebase (Single Source of Truth)

```yaml
Location: ~/Documents/GitHub/Unity-XR-AI/KnowledgeBase/

Structure:
  _MASTER_KNOWLEDGEBASE_INDEX.md      # Map of all knowledge
  _MASTER_AI_TOOLS_REGISTRY.md        # Tool configurations
  _MASTER_GITHUB_REPO_KNOWLEDGEBASE.md # 530+ repos
  _WEBGL_THREEJS_COMPREHENSIVE_GUIDE.md # Web dev
  _PERFORMANCE_PATTERNS_REFERENCE.md   # Optimization
  _ARFOUNDATION_VFX_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md  # AR/VFX
  _COMPREHENSIVE_AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md # Complete ref
  LEARNING_LOG.md                      # Continuous discoveries

Properties:
  - Version controlled (Git)
  - Modular (load only what's needed)
  - Cross-referenced
  - Token-optimized
  - Self-documenting
```

### 2. Symlink Distribution (Zero-Latency Sync)

```yaml
Implementation:
  ~/.claude/knowledgebase → Main KB
  ~/.windsurf/knowledgebase → Main KB
  ~/.cursor/knowledgebase → Main KB
  ~/.windsurf/CLAUDE.md → ~/CLAUDE.md
  ~/.cursor/CLAUDE.md → ~/CLAUDE.md

Benefits:
  - Instant sync (no copying)
  - Zero disk duplication
  - Single edit updates all tools
  - Operating system level (fast)
  - Works offline

Command:
  KB=~/Documents/GitHub/Unity-XR-AI/KnowledgeBase
  ln -sf $KB ~/.claude/knowledgebase
  ln -sf $KB ~/.windsurf/knowledgebase
  ln -sf $KB ~/.cursor/knowledgebase
```

### 3. MCP Memory Server (Shared Knowledge Graph)

```yaml
Purpose: Persistent, queryable memory across all tools

Setup:
  # In each tool's mcp.json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "memory": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
      }
    }
  }

Knowledge Graph Structure:
  Entities:
    - Projects (Portals_6, Paint-AR)
    - Technologies (Unity, AR Foundation, Three.js)
    - People (Keijiro, Dilmerv, Unity-Technologies)
    - Patterns (Object pooling, Instancing, Burst jobs)
    - Repos (github.com/keijiro/SplatVFX, etc.)

  Relations:
    - "Portals_6" uses "AR Foundation 6.2.1"
    - "Keijiro" created "SplatVFX"
    - "Object pooling" optimizes "Quest 2 performance"
    - "Unity-Technologies" maintains "EntityComponentSystemSamples"

  Observations:
    - "Quest 2 performs best with <100k particles"
    - "Addressables reduce initial load by 80%"
    - "VFX Graph GPU events are 10x faster than CPU"
    - "Three.js InstancedMesh handles 1M objects at 144fps"

Benefits:
  - Persistent across sessions
  - Queryable by any tool
  - Grows with each interaction
  - Semantic connections
  - Context-aware responses
```

### 4. Learning Log (Append-Only Discovery Journal)

```yaml
Path: ~/Documents/GitHub/Unity-XR-AI/KnowledgeBase/LEARNING_LOG.md

Format:
  ## 2025-01-07 22:30 - Claude Code - Portals_6
  **Discovery**: Burst-compiled jobs are 50x faster than MonoBehaviour loops

## Intelligence Amplification Strategies

### 1. Cross-Project Pattern Recognition

```yaml
Mechanism: Track similar solutions across different projects

Example:
  Project A: Object pooling for particles → 3x performance
  Project B: Object pooling for networking → 5x performance
  Project C: Object pooling for audio → 4x performance

  Pattern Emerges: Object pooling universally improves performance
  Action: Add to _PERFORMANCE_PATTERNS_REFERENCE.md as general pattern
  Impact: All future projects benefit immediately
```

### 2. Technology Mapping

```yaml
Mechanism: Map Unity concepts to WebGL equivalents

Example:
  Unity: GameObject instancing
  WebGL: InstancedMesh in Three.js

  Unity: Addressables
  WebGL: Dynamic imports + code splitting

  Unity: Burst compiler
  WebGL: Web Workers + SIMD

Action: Maintain mapping table in knowledge base
Impact: Easier cross-platform development
```

### 3. Expert Network Building

```yaml
Mechanism: Track who creates what

Knowledge Graph:
  Keijiro → VFX Graph effects
  Dilmerv → XR tutorials
  Unity-Technologies → Official samples
  Aras-P → Gaussian Splatting
  PlayCanvas → WebGL splatting

Action: When need VFX → Check Keijiro first
Impact: Go directly to best sources
```

### 4. Performance Database

```yaml
Mechanism: Track all performance measurements

Data Points:
  - Device: Quest 2
  - Operation: 50k particles with Burst jobs
  - FPS: 90
  - Frame time: 11.1ms
  - Technique: Object pooling + Burst compiler

Action: Build performance prediction model
Impact: Know expected performance before implementing
```

## Token Optimization at Scale

### Intelligent Loading

```yaml
Strategy: Load only what's needed for current task

Session Start (5K tokens):
  - Load: Global CLAUDE.md
  - Load: Master Index
  - Wait: User request

Unity Task Detected (+10K tokens):
  - Load: Relevant GitHub repos section
  - Load: AR Foundation snippets if AR
  - Load: Performance patterns if optimization

WebGL Task Detected (+8K tokens):
  - Load: Three.js guide
  - Load: CodeSandbox examples section
  - Load: Web performance patterns

Research Task (+15K tokens):
  - Load: Full GitHub KB
  - Load: Comprehensive guide relevant sections
  - Web search as needed

Total Max: ~40K tokens (well within 200K limit)
```

### Compression Techniques

```yaml
Method 1: Reference Instead of Copy
  ❌ Include full Unity docs
  ✅ Link to docs.unity3d.com

Method 2: Code Snippets Not Full Files
  ❌ Include entire script
  ✅ Show key pattern (10-20 lines)

Method 3: Categorize by Use Case
  ❌ Load everything
  ✅ Load only relevant category

Method 4: Regular Consolidation
  - Monthly review
  - Merge similar sections
  - Archive outdated
  - Extract patterns
```
