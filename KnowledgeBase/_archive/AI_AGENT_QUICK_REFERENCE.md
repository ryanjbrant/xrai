# AI Agent Quick Reference - Daily Execution Checklist

**Context**: Use this 30-second checklist before every AI interaction to activate superhuman execution mode.

---

## Pre-Task (5 seconds) ⚡

**Ask yourself**:

- [ ] Can I reuse existing solution? (Knowledgebase/past projects)
- [ ] What's the 20% effort that gives 80% result?
- [ ] What pattern will I extract from this?

**Tell AI**:

> "Before we start: Check knowledgebase for similar solutions. Focus on highest-leverage approach. I want to extract reusable patterns."

---

## During Task 🎯

**Activate billionaire thinking**:

- [ ] Systems over symptoms (what's the underlying pattern?)
- [ ] Asymmetric outcomes (1 hour that saves 100 hours)
- [ ] Long-term compounding (will this solution scale?)

**Ask AI for**:

- Mental models & trade-offs (not just implementation)
- Uncommon resources & edge cases (not just obvious docs)
- Cross-project patterns (how does this apply elsewhere?)

---

## Post-Task (10 seconds) 📝

**Knowledge capture**:

- [ ] Did we discover a reusable pattern? → `LEARNING_LOG.md`
- [ ] Can this be automated? → Note for future
- [ ] What did I learn about learning? → Meta-reflection

**Format for LEARNING_LOG.md**:

```markdown
## [Date] - [Title]

**Discovery**: [What we learned]
**Pattern**: [Reusable approach]
**Future Application**: [Where else]
**ROI**: [Time saved/leverage gained]
```

## Emergency Override 🚨

**If stuck for >5 minutes**:

1. Simplify: What's the dumbest solution that could work?
2. Leverage: Who/what has solved this already?
3. Reframe: Is this even the right problem?
4. Ship: Can I ship 20% solution now and iterate?

---

## Leverage Hierarchy (Always prefer higher)

1. ✅ **Use existing** (0 hours)
2. ✅ **Adapt from knowledgebase** (0.1x time)
3. ✅ **AI-assisted with review** (0.3x time)
4. ⚠️ **Write from scratch** (1x time - avoid)

---

## Identity Reprogramming Triggers

When you catch yourself thinking:

- ❌ "I need to research more" → ✅ "MVP in 10 min, iterate"
- ❌ "This might not work" → ✅ "Test in 30 seconds"
- ❌ "Do this manually" → ✅ "Automate this"

---

## Daily Metrics (Track progress)

**End of day** (2 minutes):

- Leverage ratio: Hours saved / hours invested
- Insights extracted: New patterns discovered
- Automation coverage: Tasks automated today

**End of week**:

- Speed: Am I solving problems 2x faster?
- Knowledge: How many patterns reused?
- Complexity: Is my life simpler or more complex?

## Sample AI Prompts (Copy-paste ready)

**Start of session**:

> "Activate billionaire-level systems thinking. Check knowledgebase for similar solutions. Focus on highest-leverage, lowest-cost approach. Explain trade-offs and extract reusable patterns as we go."

**When stuck**:

> "Emergency override: What's the simplest solution that works right now? Who else has solved this? Should we even be solving this?"

**End of session**:

> "Extract 2-3 mental models from this session for LEARNING_LOG.md. What patterns can we reuse? What automation opportunities exist?"
